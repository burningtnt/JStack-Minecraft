### Introduction
**JStack Minecraft** is an analysis tool specifically developed for **Minecraft: Java Edition**. It can generate a snapshot of the game's running stack so that crash analysts can quickly find the cause of your game freeze.

### Usage

2. Run the **Run_Windows.bat** file (Windows Users) or **Run_Mac.command** file (Mac Users) in the unzipped folder.
3. Wait until a black window pops up displaying the word **Finish**, and then upload the selected file in the preview window that pops up later.
